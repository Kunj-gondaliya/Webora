  <h2>What Is Minimalist Design?</h2>
  <p>
    Minimalist design is a visual style focused on simplicity, clarity, and the removal 
    of anything that does not serve a purpose. It highlights clean layouts, open space, 
    and a strong focus on usability. In today’s digital world—where attention spans are 
    shorter than ever—minimalism helps users focus on what truly matters.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Is Minimalism So Popular?</h2>
  <p>
    Over the last few years, minimalism has taken over everything—from websites and apps 
    to logos and product packaging. Here’s why it’s trending:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clean & uncluttered layouts</strong> improve user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Faster website loading</strong> due to fewer elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Stronger visual hierarchy</strong> helps users find information quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Modern and premium aesthetic</strong> matches current brand identity trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Better responsiveness</strong> across mobile and tablet devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Elements of Minimalist Design</h2>
  <p>Minimalism isn’t about removing everything—it’s about keeping only what's necessary.  
  These are the core elements:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Neutral colors:</strong> Whites, blacks, soft grays, and muted tones.</li>
    <li><strong>Simple typography:</strong> Clean, sans-serif fonts like Inter or Helvetica.</li>
    <li><strong>Large spacing:</strong> Breathing room improves readability.</li>
    <li><strong>Flat or subtle shadows:</strong> No clutter, no over-styled elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Functional layout:</strong> Every element has a purpose.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Examples of Minimalist Websites</h2>
  <p>Many top companies use minimalistic design to build trust and showcase professionalism:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Apple — clean layouts and strong product focus</li>
    <li>Google — simple interfaces and functional UX</li>
    <li>Dropbox — whitespace-heavy modern UI</li>
    <li>Notion — clean typography + plenty of spacing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Should You Use Minimalist Design?</h2>
  <p>
    If you're trying to create a modern brand, improve UX, and reduce distractions—yes, 
    minimalism is an excellent choice. But remember: minimal does NOT mean empty. It means 
    deliberate, thoughtful, and functional.
