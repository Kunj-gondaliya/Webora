    <h1>Case Study: Priya – Freelance Designer</h1>
  </header>

  <section class="case-content">
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Priya, a talented freelance graphic designer, relied on WhatsApp and Instagram DMs to showcase her work. This looked unprofessional to high-value clients. She often lost projects because clients wanted a portfolio link, and she had none. She needed a personal brand that showcased her skills and positioned her as a premium designer.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Webora created a personal brand identity for Priya.

Built a minimal yet powerful portfolio website with categories like Branding, UI/UX, and Social Media Graphics.

Added a “Book a Call” system so clients could directly schedule consultation slots.

Designed a strong About Me page that shared her journey, process, and testimonials.

Added a downloadable portfolio PDF for offline sharing.

Connected her site with Google Analytics so she could see which services clients were most interested in.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Within 1 month of launch, Priya landed 4 new premium clients, each paying more than her usual projects.

She received collaboration offers from agencies in Delhi and Mumbai.

Her personal brand felt so professional that she tripled her pricing — and clients still said yes.

Today, she gets 70% of her projects via her portfolio site, reducing her dependency on Instagram.</p>
